The functionalities that are to be added/updated according to my observation are:

1. The hyperlinks under the images/icons of the Virtual labs and IIIT Hyderabad are to added.
2. There should be a naviagation bar present for every page.
3. After entering an improper order of words. It shows WRONG ANSWER!!!. Then under that text, there is a button "GET CORRECT SENTENCE", after clicking it and getting the answers and then 
after clicking "HIDE THE CORRECT SENTENCE", it is again showing "GET ANSWERS", this is no need, this has to be removed.
4. After getting the RIGHT ANSWER!!!, there is no requirement for re-arranging the words button.
5. "CORRECT ANSWER!!!" would be better than "RIGHT ANSWER!!!".
